# Beginning Electronics Corse Description

This course is designed to teach beginning electronics
concepts to students that may not have a strong math
background.  It focuses on using low-cost parts
combined with interactive simulations (MicroSims)
to help build an intuitive sense of how electronics
works for students.

To get started our baseline lessons assume that students have access to some basic
low-cost electronics components such as a solderless
breadboard, 5v USB power supply and simple components
such as wires, LEDs, resistors, buttons, potentiometers, photosensors, 
motors, transistors, 74565 shift registers and 555 timers.  
It is amazing how many fun projects we can create from these simple components.

This course touches on some of the basic ideas around digital
electronics, but it does not cover digital logic more complicated than an simple
memory cell, flip flop and shift register (74595).  
See our [Digital Electronics](https://dmccreary.github.io/digital-electronics/) course for these topics.

After we cover how to use the breadboard to build some simple
circuits, we then discuss some simple low-cost kits
that can be purchased on eBay to demonstrate ideas such
as photocells, night lights, voltage meters, voltage regulators, buck converters,
signal generators.  These kits generally cost about $10 and
are great ways to apply the concepts we have learned in the basic
section.

We also include an optional final projects section that discusses
how to package your project including how to solder components
onto a perf board.

We also do not cover microcontrollers in this course.  For that topic
we strongly suggest you guide your students to our course 
on [Microcontrollers](https://dmccreary.github.io/learning-micropython/).  These courses are designed to work together.

## Bloom Taxonomy

We use the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy to distribute our course content from foundational materials through application and creation stages.

    For the course-description.md file in this project, rewrite it in terms of a formal course description using the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy.  Start with foundational terms and definitions and move toward concepts that require students to create their own projects.

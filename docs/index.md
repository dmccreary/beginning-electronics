Welcome to the **Beginning Electronics for Kids** website.  This
site is full of resources to make learning electronics fun!

To get started, all you need is a $20 kit of electronic parts and this
guide.  We work with generative AI tools to build custom lesson plans
based on the age of your students, the parts you have and your
learning objectives.

Have fun!

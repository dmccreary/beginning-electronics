# Beginning Electronics for Kids

![](./img/banner.png)

Welcome to the **Beginning Electronics for Kids** website.  This
site is full of resources to make learning electronics fun!

To get started, all you need is a $20 kit of electronic parts and this
guide.  We work with generative AI tools to build custom lesson plans
based on the age of your students, the parts you have and your
learning objectives.

## How does it work?

We guide to in the process of building lesson plans that are
customized to your learning task.  Your prompt might
include the following:

1. Your age or grade in school.
2. What you want to learn.
3. Any lessons you have already finished.
4. Any parts you have on hand.
5. How much time you have available.

Our system will then generate a lesson plan and a circuit
diagram of what you want to learn.

## How to use this website

You can use the left navigation bar to see how
to get started and lesson plans.  There is also
a search function in the upper right corner.

Lastly, we have lots of suggestions on how to
go further in your learning with suggested
resources on building LED strips, costumes, robots
and how to learn more about AI.

Have fun!

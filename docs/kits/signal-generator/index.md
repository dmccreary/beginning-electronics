# Signal Generator

The XR2206 chip generates three types of waves:

1. Sine
2. Square
3. Triangle

1. The components are welding the front board, from low to high principles, namely the first low welding components, such as, capacitor, resistor, diode, etc.
2.Welding IC socket, terminal blocks, finally power socket, adjustable potentiometer.
3.The back with a diagonal cutting pliers to cut short the pins as far as possible
4．Debugging steps:
1．After completion of welding on IC, XR2206, pay attention to the direction of IC, insert the might damage the chip!
2. check the IC whether against, such as anti please timely correction.
3. Insert the power supply, power supply for 5.5 * 2.1 port, inside outside is negative polarity. For 9-12 v power supply voltage. The waveform may not be stable for more than 12 v
5．Using the step：
1. J1 jumper cap plug in, SIN/TRI blue terminals output sine wave (note J1, J2 can only insert one of)|
|2. J2 jumper cap plug in, SIN/TRI blue terminals output triangular wave (note J1, J2 can only insert one of)
3. SQU blue terminals output pulse
4. AMP :  Sine wave, triangle wave amplitude adjustment
5. FINE :  Frequency fine adjustment
6. Coarse : Frequency of coarse adjustment

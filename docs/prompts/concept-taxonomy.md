# Concept Taxonomy

!!! prompt
    You are a expert at creating taxonomies for learning concepts.
    I would like you to create a 10-classification taxonomy system to classify each Concept
    in the concept dependency list. 

    For example here are some suggestions: 

    1. Foundation Concepts 
    2. Terms and Definitions
    3. Electrical Components
    ...
    10. Student Projects


## Response

Based on analyzing the concept data and considering the course description, I propose the following 10-classification taxonomy system:

1.  **Fundamental Physics Concepts**
    -   Basic electricity principles
    -   Energy and power concepts
    -   Electron flow theory
2.  **Core Electrical Measurements**
    -   Voltage
    -   Current
    -   Resistance
    -   Basic measurements and units
3.  **Power and Energy Sources**
    -   Power supplies
    -   Batteries
    -   USB power
    -   Voltage regulation
4.  **Basic Components**
    -   Resistors
    -   LEDs
    -   Wires
    -   Breadboards
    -   Switches
5.  **Sensors and Input Devices**
    -   Photosensors
    -   Potentiometers
    -   Buttons
    -   Temperature sensors
6.  **Output and Actuator Components**
    -   Motors
    -   Speakers
    -   Display devices
    -   Indicators
7.  **Circuit Building Fundamentals**
    -   Circuit diagrams
    -   Breadboard layouts
    -   Component connections
    -   Testing methods
8.  **Simple Integrated Circuits**
    -   555 timers
    -   Shift registers
    -   Basic memory cells
    -   Voltage regulators
9.  **Circuit Analysis Skills**
    -   Series circuits
    -   Parallel circuits
    -   Voltage division
    -   Current analysis
10.  **Project Integration**

-   Kit assembly
-   Troubleshooting
-   Safety practices
-   Project documentation

This taxonomy is specifically designed to align with the course description's focus on beginners and hands-on learning, while providing a clear progression from fundamental concepts to practical applications. It avoids advanced digital electronics topics (as mentioned in the course description) while maintaining a strong focus on practical, buildable circuits.

Would you like me to analyze how the concepts from your CSV file map to these categories? I can help create a more detailed breakdown of which concepts fall into each category.

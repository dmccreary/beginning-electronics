# Concept Dependency Prompt

You are an expert at creating dependency graphs for learning new concepts.
For each new concept you are given, you have great skills at understanding what
other concepts from a fixed list of concepts must be understood before a new
concept can be understood.

I am creating a course on Beginning Electronics for a local high school.
I have a list of the 225 concepts taught in this course.  The 225 concepts
are provided in a CSV file format below.  The input format is the following:

1. Column 1 is the ConceptID
2. Column 2 is the ConceptLabel

Please create a new CSV file of fully connected concept dependency graph
for the concepts in this course.
In this step, for each Concept on this list below, create a new
list of other concepts on which it depends.  If a concept
depends on a specific concept that is not listed,
then we will need to add it as a new concept.
This will help us determine the teaching order of the Concepts.

Return the new list as a CSV file using the following format:

1. The first column in the CSV file is a ConceptID from the input file we provided you.
2. The second column is the ConceptLabel from the input file we provided you.
3. The third column is called Dependencies and it is a pipe-delimited list of the Concept IDs that the concept depends upon.  You will provide this information.

Check your results to make sure that all concepts are connected to at least one other concept.

Foundation Concepts are concepts that have no dependant concepts in this set.  Limit
the foundation concepts to the following:

1,Electricity
2,Voltage
3,Current
4,Resistance
29,Breadboard

Foundation Concepts have an empty Dependencies third column.

Here is your input which are the 225 core concepts for our Beginning Electronics course:

### ChatGPT Reasoning Steps

**Mapping concepts**

I'm organizing a CSV with ConceptID, ConceptLabel, and Dependencies. Foundation concepts need no dependencies, while the rest depend on the set \[1..225\]. All concepts must link to at least one dependency.

**Ensuring connectivity**

Aw, man, I'm making sure every concept, even "Ground," links back to the foundational ideas like "Electricity" and "Voltage." This step-by-step approach key to achieving full connectivity.

**Assigning dependencies**

I'm piecing together dependencies for each concept, ensuring all essential concepts are included. If necessary, new concepts will be added to complete the list.

**Ensuring connectivity**

I'm making sure every concept links to at least one other concept, except the 5 foundational ones, resulting in a fully connected dependency graph.

**Mapping out the hierarchy**

First, I drop the foundational concepts: Electricity, Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Breadboard. Then, I aim to link "Ground" to one of these foundational ideas, like Electricity.

**Linking dependencies**

Connecting the dots: concepts "5, Ground" to dependencies "1|2", "6, Power Source" to "1|2", and "7, USB Power" to "6|2|1". This builds a structured hierarchy of dependencies.

**Exploring dependencies**

Breaking down "Battery Power" to "Power Source" or "Electricity/Voltage," and tracing battery ratings and voltage standards from there. This approach helps identify dependents and connections.

**Strategizing a streamlined approach**

Charting a course for a large graph, I'm generating a fully connected concept dependency graph with unique value combinations, ensuring each concept except the five foundations has connections.

**Simplifying concepts**

I'm working through 220 concepts, ensuring each is connected to at least one other. Starting with foundational ideas and expanding from there, the goal is to create a fully integrated dependency graph.

**Verifying connections**

I'm checking that each concept from the list links to a foundational idea, ensuring all are included and logically consistent. Producing a comprehensive CSV to confirm this task.

**Systematic progression**

I'm mapping out a clear path: starting with foundational elements and leading towards 225 interconnected concepts. Ensuring each concept is logically linked maintains streamlined, progressive structure.

**Focusing on core concepts**

I'm honing in on essential concepts like "Ground," "Power Source," and "Battery Ratings," ensuring each logically connects to foundational ideas for a clear, streamlined dependency chain.

**Synthesizing dependencies**

I'm assembling a reliable set of dependencies, highlighting core concepts and their connections, and streamlining them to match fundamental electronics knowledge. Progress is being made towards constructing a solid foundation.

**Charting progress**

I'm mapping out dependencies for 225 concepts, focusing on foundational ideas and electronics knowledge. This approach will streamline connectivity and ensure logical coherence throughout the chain.

**Revisiting dependencies**

I'm rethinking the connections, balancing general concepts like "Switch" with specific ones like "Momentary Switch" and "Push Button," and ensuring logical coherence in the sequence.

**Mapping out dependencies**

I'm organizing connections like "Push Button" tying back to "Switch Types," which depend on the "Circuit" concept. This streamlines the logical flow and clarity of the dependencies.

**Connecting the pieces**

I'm linking "Switch States" to "Circuit," ensuring a logical flow that ties together concepts like "Switch Types," "Momentary Switch," and "Push Button," thus strengthening the overall coherence of the dependencies.

**Tracing interconnectedness**

I'm connecting concepts like "Switch States" to "Circuit" and "Switch Types," ensuring logical progress. Then, I link "Potentiometer" to "Resistor," and "DC Motor" to "Direct Current," maintaining coherence.

**Mapping dependencies**

Piecing together the flow, I link "Flyback Diode" to "Rectifier" and consider "Diodes" in relation to "Transistor." This ensures a clear progression in the circuit understanding.

**Charting connections**

I'm identifying and evaluating dependencies, like "Flyback Diode" linked to "Rectifier" while avoiding adding new concepts unless necessary. This clarification ensures a logical progression.

**Charting dependencies**

I'm mapping out the logical progression of dependencies for "Flyback Diode" and "LED," considering their link to "AC to DC Conversion" and ensuring a clear understanding of the circuit's functionality.

**Creating and connecting**

I'm thinking of introducing a new concept, "Diode," and linking it to "Conductivity." Meanwhile, considering a simpler approach to streamline the dependency chain for coherence.

**Connecting concepts**

I'm mapping out a "star approach" for dependencies, ensuring each concept, except the foundation ones, connects to one of five key concepts. Progressing towards a more cohesive structure.

**Focusing the strategy**

I'm thinking through simplifying connections, ensuring every concept ties back to fundamental concepts like "Electricity," "Voltage," or "Current." This method maintains logical coherence and progress.

**Taking a closer look**

I'm simplifying the process with a step-by-step approach, focusing on "circuit," "component," "voltage," "current," "resistance," or "breadboard" connections for each concept.

**Ensuring alignment**

I'm classifying concepts by labels like "Voltage," "Current," and "Resistance," linking them to their respective foundations, and piecing together a cohesive CSV file with clear, logical connections.

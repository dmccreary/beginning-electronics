# Beginning Electronics Course Description

!!! prompt
    For the course-description.md file in this project, rewrite it in terms of a formal course description using the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy.  Start with foundational terms and definitions and move toward concepts that require students to create their own projects.

I have restructured the course description to align with Bloom's Taxonomy, creating a more comprehensive and pedagogically sound document. The new description:

1.  Clearly outlines learning outcomes at each cognitive level
2.  Maintains the original course's practical, hands-on approach
3.  Organizes content in a progressive manner
4.  Preserves the focus on accessibility and low-cost components
5.  Includes clear scope limitations and pathways to advanced topics

## Course Overview
This introductory electronics course is designed for students with limited mathematical background, emphasizing hands-on learning through low-cost components and interactive simulations (MicroSims). The course structure follows a progressive learning path that builds from fundamental concepts to practical applications.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

### Remember and Understand

It focuses on using low-cost parts combined with interactive simulations (MicroSims) to help build an intuitive sense of how electronics works for students.</p> <p>To get started our baseline lessons assume that students have access to some basic low-cost electronics components such as a solderless breadboard, 5v USB power supply and simple components such as wires, LEDs, resistors, buttons, potentiometers, photosensors,  motors, transistors, 74565 shift registers and 555 timers. It is amazing how many fun projects we can create from these simple components.</p> <p>This course touches on some of the basic ideas around digital electronics, but it does not cover digital logic more complicated than an simple memory cell, flip flop and shift register (74595). See our Digital Electronics course for these topics.</p> <p>After we cover how to use the breadboard to build some simple circuits, we then discuss some simple low-cost kits that can be purchased on eBay to demonstrate ideas such as photocells, night lights, voltage meters, voltage regulators, buck converters, signal generators.  These kits generally cost about $10 and are great ways to apply the concepts we have learned in the basic section.</p> <p>We also include an optional final projects section that discusses how to package your project including how to solder components onto a perf board.</p> <p>We also do not cover microcontrollers in this course.  For that topic we strongly suggest you guide your students to our course  on Microcontrollers.

Here's a list of the visible components and their typical uses:</p> <ol> <li> <p>LM2596 IC: The large black component with five legs on one side is the LM2596 voltage regulator IC. It's the main component that controls the conversion process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Input Capacitor: The large cylindrical component labeled \"100 VTP 470\" on the left is an electrolytic capacitor, likely used to filter the input voltage to the buck converter. The \"100\" may indicate the voltage rating, and \"470\" likely indicates the capacitance in microfarads (\u03bcF).</p> </li> <li> <p>Output Capacitor: Similar to the input capacitor, the other large cylindrical component on the right near the out is also an electrolytic capacitor used to filter the output voltage of the buck converter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inductor: The large, square, metallic component with the \"470\" on it is the inductor. This is a crucial component in a buck converter that stores and releases energy to smooth out the current flow and stabilize the output voltage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Diode: The small black component below the regulator labeled SS34 is likely a Schottky diode, which provides a path for current when the switching transistor inside the LM2596 is off, preventing reverse current that could damage the IC or reduce efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Potentiometer: The blue component labeled \"W103\" with a screw on top is a potentiometer, which is used to set the output voltage. By turning the screw, the resistance changes, which adjusts the output voltage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feedback Resistors: While not clearly labeled, there are typically a couple of small resistors that form a voltage divider network for the feedback loop. This helps the LM2596 regulate the output voltage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rectification Diode (Not visible): Usually, there's a diode involved in the buck conversion process, but it might not be visible in this image. It would typically be used for rectification, ensuring current flows in the proper direction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heat Sink: The large metal area around the LM2596 IC is a heat sink to dissipate heat generated by the IC during operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>SMD Components: There are several small, surface-mounted devices (SMDs) that could be additional capacitors, resistors, or diodes to support the circuit's stability and performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Input/Output Terminals: The \"IN+\" and \"OUT+\" labels indicate the input and output terminals for the voltage supply and the voltage out to the load, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>LED Indicator (Not visible): Some modules also include an LED indicator to signal when the device is powered, though it's not visible in this image.</p> </li> <li> <p>Printed Circuit Board (PCB): All these components are mounted on a PCB, which provides the electrical connections between them according to the buck converter circuit design.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This module is designed to make it easy for users to incorporate a buck converter into their projects without having to design and build the circuit from scratch.

These holes are usually spaced about 0.1 inches (2.54 mm) apart. Each hole is surrounded by a small copper pad (a little ring of copper) on one side of the board. You can insert electronic components such as resistors, LEDs, capacitors, integrated circuits, and wires through these holes, and then solder the component leads on the other side. This creates a permanent (or semi-permanent) connection between components.</p> <p>Perfboards are commonly used when you move beyond the initial planning and experimentation stage of your project. After you\u2019ve tested a circuit on a solderless breadboard, a perfboard lets you solder it all together into a more stable and durable form. While not as fancy or as permanent as a fully designed printed circuit board (PCB), a perfboard is a great stepping stone that helps turn your prototype into a more reliable device.</p> <p>Suggested Photo: - Photo of a perfboard for sale on e-bay: Show a standard rectangular perfboard with regularly spaced holes and copper pads visible on one side.

You can find different types that vary in size, material, and how their copper pads are arranged.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Basic Single-Sided Perfboards:    These have copper pads on one side only. Each hole has its own separate copper pad. This is the most common and straightforward type. You must connect pads together by soldering wires, component leads, or by using small pieces of wire to bridge connections between holes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripboard (Veroboard):    Similar to a perfboard but with rows (or strips) of copper pads connected together. Instead of each pad being isolated, a stripboard\u2019s holes are arranged along copper tracks. These tracks can be cut if needed. Stripboards make it easier to create rows of connected pads, reducing the amount of wiring you need.</p> </li> <li> <p>Double-Sided Perfboards:    These have copper pads on both sides of the board. Double-sided boards make it possible to connect circuits on either side and sometimes simplify more complicated projects because you can route connections more easily.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pre-Soldered Protoboards with Buses:    Some perfboards come with pre-connected power rails or \u201cbuses\u201d to make it easier to provide power (e.g., 5V or ground) to all your components. This can reduce the amount of wiring you do for the common connections.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Suggested Photo: - Photo showing different types of perfboards: A photo with multiple perfboards laid out side-by-side. Include a basic single-sided perfboard, a stripboard, and a double-sided perfboard. The image might show them at an angle so the viewer can see the copper pads and strips. Perhaps labels or captions in the image help identify each type.

Make sure to align integrated circuits so their notch or marking is oriented correctly.

LEDs have a longer leg (anode) and a shorter leg (cathode). The longer leg should be connected towards the positive side of your circuit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add a Resistor: Connect a resistor to the anode (longer leg) of the LED. This is important to prevent the LED from burning out due to too much current.</p> </li> <li> <p>Insert the Push Button: Place the push button somewhere on the breadboard. Push buttons usually have four legs. When pressed, they connect the legs on one side to the legs on the other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Connect the Battery: Attach one end of a jumper wire to the positive terminal of the battery. Connect the other end of this wire to one of the legs of the resistor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complete the Circuit: Use another jumper wire to connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to one side of the push button. Then, use another wire to connect the other side of the button to the negative terminal of the battery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test Your Circuit: When everything is connected, press the button.
